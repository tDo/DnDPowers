#DnD Powers
## Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition Power card helper for mobile devices

The purpose of this software is to provide a small interface to display character power
cards on mobile touch systems like iOS or Android. It allows to display "At-Will", "Encounter"
and "Daily" powers as a convenient list which allows toggling of further content as well as marking
powers as "used" via a simple right swipe (and unmarking them again via a left swipe).

This small app does not required anything but a very simple web server which is capable
of serving files (No PHP, Ruby, Python, etc. required). Just copy all files to a folder
which is served by a webserver and direct your browser to the uri of the index.html

Character File
--------------
The character is stored in a single json file `./character.json`

The file hols a simple object structure which places powers in the different categories

    {
      "at_will": [],
      "encounter": [],
      "daily": []
    }
    
Each categories represents an array of cards which themselves are also represented as json objects with pre-defined keys
which hold information about the character.
<dl>
    <dt>name<sup>*</sup></dt><dd>Name of the power</dd>
    <dt>level<sup>*</sup></dt><dd>Power level</dd>
    <dt>summary<sup>*</sup></dt><dd>Short power summary</dd>
    <dt>keywords<sup>*</sup></dt><dd>Array holding the multiple power keywords</dd>
    <dt>action<sup>*</sup></dt><dd>The power action type (Standard, Minor, Free)</dd>
    <dt>type<sup>*</sup></dt><dd>Type of the attack (Meelee, Range, etc.)</dd>
    <dt>target</dt><dd>Target of the power</dd>
    <dt>attack</dt><dd>Attack attributes (x vs. y)</dd>
    <dt>trigger</dt><dd>Power trigger</dd>
    <dt>hit</dt><dd>What happens on a hit</dd>
    <dt>miss</dt><dd>What happens on a miss</dd>
    <dt>effect</dt><dd>Power effect</dd>
    <dt>special</dt><dd>Special notes (Typically noted on the power cards)</dd>
    <dt>subnote</dt><dd>A subnote (Like Does xy on Level 11)</dd>
</dl>

<small>Entries marked with <sup>*</sup> are required</small>

So an example might look like this

    { "name":     "Sacred Flame",
      "level":    "Cleric Attack 1",
      "summary":  "Sacred light shines from above, searing a single enemy with its radiance while at the same time aiding an ally with its beneficent power.",
      "keywords": ["Divine", "Implement", "Radiant"],
      "action":   "Standard Action",
      "type":     "Ranged 5",
      "target":   "One Creature",
      "attack":   "Wisdom vs. Reflex",
      "hit":      "1d6 + Wisdom modifier radiant damage, and one ally you can see chooses either to gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + one-half your level or to make a saving throw.",
      "subnote":  "Increase damage to 2d6 + Wisdom modifier at 21st level."
    }
    
A full example character (My cleric "Belgretor Tamiklos") can be found in `./example_character.json`
